    excerpt: "Andrew is a meditator, former startup operator, and recovering “highly logical person” who is on a journey to connect with his feelings, intuition, and most authentic self. There’s nothing he loves more than bringing people together and creating a sense of belonging. As a T-group facilitator, he aspires to guide participants in discovering and communicating their needs and boundaries, expressing themselves more freely and authentically, and letting the practice of becoming more closely attuned to ourselves become the foundation for true connection and belonging."

## What is T-Group

T-group[^1] is an experiential and effective way of learning about yourself and others. You will get an opportunity to increase your awareness of your feelings, perceptions, needs and behaviors.

During the session, you will receive a little bit of conceptual content and a lot of immersive practice that will help you horn your interpersonal communication skills. 

The practice you get during this course in building trusted relationships can be applied with friends and family and at work.

[^1]: T means training. [READ MORE about T-Group](./assets/files/power-of-t-group.pdf)
