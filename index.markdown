## What is T-Group

T-group[^1] is an experiential and effective way of learning about yourself and others. You will get an opportunity to increase your awareness of your feelings, perceptions, needs and behaviors.

During the session, you will receive a little bit of conceptual content and a lot of immersive practice that will help you hore your interpersonal communication skills. 

The practice you get during this course in building trusted relationships can be applied with friends and family and at work.

[^1]: T means training. [READ MORE about T-Group](./assets/files/power-of-t-group.pdf)

## What we believe

At Oneness, we hold a profound belief that the fundamental needs of all human beings are universal: Connection, Love, and Belonging. We also believe that every individual is born to be resourceful, creative, and whole.

Guided by these beliefs, the vision of Oneness is to foster a profound connection among all individuals—uniting us as one, even if we seem like isolated islands on the surface of life’s vast ocean.

Our mission is to nurture people, awaken their innate potential to grow and thrive. At Oneness, we are committed to empowering individuals to rediscover their true nature and embrace their limitless possibilities.
